      <h2> Who doesnâ€™t like Chocolate?! But do we know anything about the history of it?</h2>

 <p> In this short paragraph, I will explore in brief the origin of this product.</p>  
<p> Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground coca beans that can be a:
  <ul>
    <li>Liquid,</li>
    <li>Solid,</li>
    <li>Paste, with different flavours like fruits.</li>
  </ul>
     </p>

<p>The history of chocolate dates back more than 5000 years, when the coca tree was first domesticated in present-day southeast Ecuador. <br>
Then it was introduced to Mesoamerica, where coca drinks gained significance as an elite beverage among cultures like the Maya.</p>
      <p> <strong>Coca</strong> was considered as a:
  <ol>
    <li>Gift</li>
    <li>Medicine</li>
    <li>Ceremonies.</li>
  </ol><br> 
      In modern life, <strong><em>Chocolate</em></strong> becomes one of the most ingredients used to make desserts, ice creams, cakes, mousse, and cookies.</p>
